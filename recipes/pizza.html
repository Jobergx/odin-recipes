        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg white bread flour or Tipo '00' flour </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 x 7 g dried yeast sachets</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>  4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>  
      </div>
        <div class="Method">
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sieve the flour/s and salt on to a clean work surface and make a well in the middle.</li>
                <li>In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and oil into 650ml of lukewarm water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well.</li>
                <li>Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. </li>
                <li>Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and when it all starts to come together,</li>
                <li>work the rest of the flour in with your clean, flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough.</li>
                <li>Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about an hour until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands </li>
                <li>You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required.</li>
            </ol>
